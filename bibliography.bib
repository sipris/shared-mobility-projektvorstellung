  abstract = {With the convergence of information and telecommunication technologies, the vision of the ‘Smart City’ is fast becoming a reality. City governments in a growing number of countries are capitalizing on these advances to ease the lives of their citizens and to increase efficiency and sustainability. In this position paper, we outline our vision for the creation of a reference architecture for Smart City projects, which could serve as the design language for creating smart cities blueprints. Such a blueprint would cater for diverse stakeholders, devices, platforms, and technologies. We argue that a new approach for designing such ultra large and ultra-heterogeneous ecosystems is needed. Hence, we propose a reference architecture inspired by several efforts in software engineering such as SOA. The proposed reference architecture would serve as a blueprint and starting point that contains architectural building blocks, best practices, and patterns; instead of starting from scratch. We present an initial meta-model with multiple views and highlight intra and inter views relationships. We survey the state of the art, outline our research approach, and suggest a research agenda for the smart city software community at large.},

  abstract = {Systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT) are continuously growing in many areas such as smart cities, home environments, buildings, agriculture, industry, etc. Device mobility is one of the key aspects of these IoT systems, but managing it could be a challenge. Mobility exposes the IoT environment or Industrial IoT (IIoT) to situations such as packet loss, increased delay or jitter, dynamism in the network topology, new security threats, etc. In addition, there is no standard for mobility management for the most commonly used IoT protocols, such as MQTT or CoAP. Consequently, managing IoT mobility is a hard, error-prone and tedious task. However, increasing the abstraction level from which the IoT systems are designed helps to tackle the underlying technology complexity. In this regard, Model-driven development approaches can help to both reduce the IoT application time to market and tackle the technological complexity to develop IoT applications. In this paper, a Domain-Specific Language based on SimulateIoT is proposed for the design, code generation and simulation of IoT systems with mobility management for the MQTT protocol. The IoT systems generated integrate the sensors, actuators, fog nodes, cloud nodes and the architecture that supports mobility, which are deployed as microservices on Docker containers and composed suitability. Finally, two case studies focused on animal tracking and a Personal mobility device (PMD) based on bicycles IoT systems are presented to show the IoT solutions deployed.},

  abstract = {The growing number of vehicles daily moving on roads increases the need of protecting the safety and security of passengers, pedestrians, and vehicles themselves. This need is intensified when considering the pervasive introduction of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) systems into modern vehicles, because this makes such vehicles potentially vulnerable from the point of view of security. The convergence of safety and security requirements is one of the main outstanding research challenges in software-intensive systems. This work reviews existing methodologies and solutions addressing security issues in the automotive domain with a focus on the integration between safety and security aspects. In particular, we identify the main security issues with vehicular communication technologies and existing gaps between state-of-the-art methodologies and their implementation in the real world. Starting from a literature survey and referring to widely accepted standards of the domain, such as AUTOSAR and ISO 26262, we discuss research challenges and set baselines for a holistic secure-by-design approach targeting safety and security aspects all along the different phases of the development process of automotive software.},

  abstract = {Voice-driven programming allows engineers to alleviate physical discomfort, pain, and injury. It also has the potential to be faster than typing and assist those with disabilities. While there are a number of solutions to voice-driven programming, Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) has yet to exploit this non-conventional but high-potential approach to software development. Standard convention in MDE practice involves creating software models using a traditional mouse and keyboard combination, or whiteboard sketch hardware. In this position paper, we introduce our vision and ideas for a Voice-Driven Modeling (VDM) approach. Our vision involves a framework that includes 3 phases: Speech Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Context Specific Modeling. We describe these 3 phases in this paper, which others can apply in their attempts to realize VDM. We additionally include our research plans for developing a VDM solution targeted at Simulink models and our early proof of concept capable of implementing several example commands. We establish the pertinence of this work through a survey that finds negligible work on VDM and highlights the potential impact this can have on the field of MDE as a whole. Specifically, it is our position that it can have a positive impact on modelers in general, modelers with disabilities, and domain experts not familiar with modeling. It is our hope that this work helps fuel research in this area, allowing for a new way to develop software models.},

  abstract = {In this section, a specially developed Agile organization and prioritization model for software vendors in a software product family environment is presented. This model is in principle generally valid for software manufacturers and equally usable for all organizations in which the development of software-based solutions and digital services plays a central role. It is obvious that this model will also deliver precise results in favor of your company's success in comparable constellations. Otherwise, you can intervene at any time and adapt the agile model for your organization and needs. The decisive factor here is the democratic inclusion of all stakeholders; we have described in detail how you should proceed in this regard. The goal of the modeling of the presented Large-Scale Agile Framework is to develop an agile organization and prioritization model suitable for software manufacturers in the environment of a software product family in order to improve cross-product organization and prioritization. With adjustment to the efficient organization of software product lines the optimization, dimensions of the technical framework, the technical documentation and the interprocess communication are in the focus of such a model. For software manufacturers projects, which represent individual software products, are the actual creation of value drivers. Thus with software manufacturers the enterprise success is directly dependent on software projects, so that a detailed structured multi-project management and controlling has absolutely a high meaning. This applies in the same way to organizations whose value drivers are digital services. This includes platform operators who pursue an analog strategy. In addition to the project level, all processes that reflect the life cycle of software products must be considered for software manufacturers in particular. Pure multi-project management (MPM) does not offer suitable solutions for this. The desire for increasing flexibility also requires a departure from conventional, rigid structures. Against it the pure MPM is a strictly hierarchical organization model with typical Top down structures in pure form and is thus no up-to-date organization model for a software manufacturer.},

  abstract = {Multimodal journey planners have been introduced with the goal to provide travellers with itineraries involving two or more means of transportation to go from one location to another within a city. Most of them take into account user preferences, their habits and are able to notify travellers with real time traffic information, delays, schedules update, etc.. To make urban mobility more sustainable, the journey planners of the future must include: (1) techniques to generate journey alternatives that take into account not only user preferences and needs but also specific city challenges and local mobility operators resources; (2) agile development approaches to make the update of the models and information used by the journey planners a self-adaptive task; (3) techniques for the continuous journeys monitoring able to understand when a current journey is no longer valid and to propose alternatives. In this paper we present the experiences matured during the development of a complete solution for mobility planning based on model-driven engineering techniques. Mobility challenges, resources and remarks are modelled by corresponding languages, which in turn support the automated derivation of a smart journey planner. By means of the introduced automation, it has been possible to reduce the complexity of encoding journey planning policies and to make journey planners more flexible and responsive with respect to adaptation needs.},

  abstract = {Ridesourcing platforms, such as Uber, Lyft and Didi, are now launching commercial on-demand ride-pooling programs that enable their affiliated drivers to serve two or more passengers in one ride. It is generally expected that successful designs of ride-pooling programs can reduce the required vehicle fleet size, and achieve various societally beneficial objectives, such as alleviating traffic congestion. The reduction in traffic congestion can in turn save travel time for both ridesourcing passengers and normal private car users. However, it is still unclear to what extent the implementation of ride-pooling affects traffic congestion and riders’ travel time. To this end, this paper establishes a model to describe the ridesourcing markets with congestion effects, which are explicitly characterized by a macroscopic fundamental diagram. We compare the time cost (sum of travel time and waiting time) of ridesourcing passengers and normal private car users (background traffic) in the ridesourcing markets without ride-pooling (each vehicle serves one passenger) and with ride-pooling (each vehicle serves one or more passengers). It is found that, a win-win situation can be achieved under some scenarios such that the implementation of on-demand ride-pooling reduces the time cost for both ridesourcing passengers and private car users. Furthermore, we find that the matching window is a key decision variable the platform leverages to affect the stationary equilibrium state. As the matching window increases, passengers are expected to wait for longer time, but the pool-matching probability (the proportion of passengers who are pool-matched) increases, which further alleviates traffic congestion and in turn reduces passengers’ travel time. It is interesting to find that, there is a globally optimal matching window for achieving the minimum time cost for ridesourcing passengers in the normal flow regime.},

  abstract = {The term System of Systems (SoS) is used to describe the coming together of independent systems, collaborating to achieve a new or higher purpose. However, the SoS concept is often misunderstood within operational environments, providing challenges towards the secure design and operation of SoSs. Limitations in existing literature indicates a need for discovery towards identifying a combination of concepts, models, and techniques suitable for assessing SoS security risk and related human factor concerns for SoS Requirements Engineering. In this article, we present OASoSIS, representing an information security risk assessment and modelling process to assist risk-based decision making in SoS Requirements Engineering. A characterisation process is introduced to capture the SoS context, supporting a SoS security risk assessment process that extends OCTAVE Allegro towards a SoS context. Resulting risk data provides a focused means to assess and model the SoS information security risk and related human factors, integrating tool-support using CAIRIS. A medical evacuation SoS case study scenario was used to test, illustrate, and validate the alignment of concepts, models, and techniques for assessing SoS information security risks with OASoSIS, where findings provide a positive basis for future work.},

Model-driven Web Engineering (MDWE) refers to the use of the model-driven engineering paradigm in Web development methodologies. It uses the models previously developed with the information obtained at the earlier stages to derive models within the current stage of the development process. Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is considered as a most important realization of MDE; therefore, it is used as a basic reference framework in this research work. One of the challenges faced by the Model-Driven Web Engineering community along the evolution of Web applications was influencing the MDA Components in all stages of web site development process. This research paper represents the enhancement process for one of existing Web Engineering (WE) approach called Web Site Design Method (WSDM) by our MDA-Based WE mechanism. The resulting method is a new MDWE methodology called MDA-based WSDM (WSDMDA).},

  abstract = {Off-the-shelves general purpose modeling languages cannot obviously cover the whole range of needs that can be encountered in current systems design. Therefore, putting efficiently Model-Driven Engineering into practice involves designing specific modeling languages. The goal is to cover in a more suitable manner a particular application domain (e.g. automotive) or specific concerns (e.g. hardware modeling) or even to focus on a given class of practitioners. In this respect, two design approaches are generally opposed which respectively propose to define domain-specific modeling languages from scratch or to customize an existing general-purpose language. This paper focuses on the latter approach and claims that UML profiles do provide handy and powerful mechanisms to design domain-specific modeling languages but are penalized by lacks of methodological guidelines and tool support. To cope with these lacks, a profile design approach is introduced, which includes a methodological framework to structure profiles design process and tool support to partly automate this process.},

  abstract = {The security of software-intensive systems is frequently attacked. High fines or loss in reputation are potential consequences of not maintaining confidentiality, which is an important security objective. Detecting confidentiality issues in early software designs enables cost-efficient fixes. A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a modeling notation, which focuses on essential, functional aspects of such early software designs. Existing confidentiality analyses on DFDs support either information flow control or access control, which are the most common confidentiality mechanisms. Combining both mechanisms can be beneficial but existing DFD analyses do not support this. This lack of expressiveness requires designers to switch modeling languages to consider both mechanisms, which can lead to inconsistencies. In this article, we present an extended DFD syntax that supports modeling both, information flow and access control, in the same language. This improves expressiveness compared to related work and avoids inconsistencies. We define the semantics of extended DFDs by clauses in first-order logic. A logic program made of these clauses enables the automated detection of confidentiality violations by querying it. We evaluate the expressiveness of the syntax in a case study. We attempt to model nine information flow cases and six access control cases. We successfully modeled fourteen out of these fifteen cases, which indicates good expressiveness. We evaluate the reusability of models when switching confidentiality mechanisms by comparing the cases that share the same system design, which are three pairs of cases. We successfully show improved reusability compared to the state of the art. We evaluated the accuracy of confidentiality analyses by executing them for the fourteen cases that we could model. We experienced good accuracy.},

  abstract = {Context Dependency management often suffers from labor intensity and complexity in creating and maintaining the dependency relations in practice. This is even more critical in a distributed development, in which developers are geographically distributed and a wide variety of tools is used. In those settings, different interpretations of software requirements or usage of different terminologies make it challenging to predict the change impact. Objective is (a) to describe a method facilitating change management in geographically distributed software engineering by effective discovery and establishment of dependency links using domain models; (b) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Method A domain model, providing a common reference point, is used to manage development objects and to automatically support dependency discovery. We propose to associate (annotate) development objects with the concepts from the model. These associations are used to compute dependency among development objects, and are stepwise refined to direct dependency links (i.e. enabling product traceability). To evaluate the method, we conducted a laboratory-based randomized experiment on two real cases. Six participants were using an implemented prototype and two comparable tools to perform simulated tasks. Results In the paper we elaborate on the proposed method discussing its functional steps. Results from the experiment show that the method can be effectively used to assist in discovery of dependency links. Users have discovered on average fourteen percent more dependency links than by using the comparable tools. Conclusions The proposed method advocates the use of domain models throughout the whole development life-cycle and is apt to facilitate multi-site software engineering. The experimental study and results suggest that the method is effective in the discovery of dependencies among development objects.},

  abstract = {Around 90\% of accidents stem from human error. Disruptive technology, especially automated vehicles (AVs), can respond to the problems by, for instance, eradicating human error when driving, thus increasing energy efficiency due to the platoon effect, and potentially giving more space to human activities by decreasing parking space; hence, with the introduction of the autonomous vehicle, the public attitude towards its adoption needs to be understood to develop appropriate strategies and policies to leverage the potential benefits. There is a lack of a systematic and comprehensive literature review on adoption attitudes toward AVs that considers various interlinked factors such as road traffic environment changes, AV transition, and policy impacts. This study aims to synthesize past research regarding public acceptance attitude toward AVs. More specifically, the study investigates driverless technology and uncertainty, road traffic environment changes, policy impact, and findings from AV adoption modelling approaches, to understand public attitudes towards AVs. The study points out critical problems and future directions for analysis of AV impacts, such as the uncertainty on AVs adoption experiment, policy implementation and action plans, the uncertainty of AV-related infrastructure, and demand modelling.},

  abstract = {Over the years, knowledge on how to engineer software-intensive system-of-systems (SoS) have been expanded and advanced. With the emergence of smart cities, which is a remarkable example of SoS, there is also an emerging need that almost any type of system should be prepared to join the smart city system and become a constituent of that SoS, even temporarily. However, several attempts to build a real SoS have stumbled on the limitations of single systems, also known as Constituent System (CS), to fully interoperate in the context of a SoS. The majority of the existing systems were not designed to be part of a SoS, interoperate in a instantaneous way, or maintain their operational independence despite their participation in one or more SoS. Based on this context, the main contribution of this paper is to exploit how to design a software architecture for systems that are intended to become part of a SoS in the future. We conducted a software architecture design process to conceive a constituent architecture for Urban Mobility domain as CS. We evaluated the architecture by means of simulation. Preliminary results reveal that our proposal comply with the requirements raised during the architectural design process and can increase the possibility of a system to be a constituent of SoS.},

  abstract = {Analyzing attacks and potential attack paths can help to identify and avoid potential security incidents. Manually estimating an attack path to a targeted software element can be complex since a software system consists of multiple vulnerable elements, such as components, hardware resources, or network elements. In addition, the elements are protected by access control. Software architecture describes the structural elements of the system, which may form elements of the attack path. However, estimating attack paths is complex since different attack paths can lead to a targeted element. Additionally, not all attack paths might be relevant since attack paths can have different properties based on the attacker's capabilities and knowledge. We developed an approach that enables architects to identify relevant attack paths based on the software architecture. We created a metamodel for filtering options and added support for describing attack paths in an architectural description language. Based on this metamodel, we developed an analysis that automatically estimates attack paths using the software architecture. This can help architects to identify relevant attack paths to a targeted component and increase the system's overall security. We evaluated our approach on five different scenarios. Our evaluation goals are to investigate our analysis's accuracy and scalability. The results suggest a high accuracy and good runtime behavior for smaller architectures.},

  abstract = {Owing to the advancements in communication and computation technologies, the dream of commercialized connected and autonomous cars is becoming a reality. However, among other challenges such as environmental pollution, cost, maintenance, security, and privacy, the ownership of vehicles (especially for Autonomous Vehicles) is the major obstacle in the realization of this technology at the commercial level. Furthermore, the business model of pay-as-you-go type services further attracts the consumer, because there is no need for upfront investment. In this vein, the idea of car-sharing (aka carpooling) is getting ground due to, at least in part, its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and affordable choice of transportation. Carpooling systems are still in their infancy and face challenges such as scheduling, matching passengers interests, business model, security, privacy, and communication. To date, a plethora of research work has already been done covering different aspects of carpooling services (ranging from applications to communication and technologies); however, there is still a lack of a holistic, comprehensive survey that can be a one-stop-shop for the researchers in this area to (i) find all the relevant information and (ii) identify the future research directions. To fill these research challenges, this article provides a comprehensive survey on carpooling in autonomous and connected vehicles and covers architecture, components, and solutions, including scheduling, matching, mobility, pricing models of carpooling. We also discuss the current challenges in carpooling and identify future research directions. This survey is aimed to spur further discussion among the research community for the effective realization of carpooling.},
